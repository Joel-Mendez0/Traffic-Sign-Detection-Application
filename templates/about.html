    <h1>Project Description</h1>
    <p>The Traffic Sign Detection for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) project is an innovative initiative aimed at enhancing UAV capabilities in traffic monitoring and safety. It leverages the You Only Look Once (YOLO) detection framework to automatically identify and analyze traffic signs in real-time, allowing UAVs to make informed decisions during navigation.The project's primary objective was to develop an effective traffic sign detection system using YOLO, specifically tailored for UAVs. This involved thorough methodologies, including setting up the environment, collecting and preprocessing datasets, training the model, and optimizing its performance using the Optuna library.The web application, crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using the Flask framework, serves as the user interface for testing and implementing the project. The application allows real-time detection from live webcam feeds and analysis of pre-recorded videos, contributing to the overall usability of the system.The project's significance lies in its potential to improve traffic monitoring and safety for UAVs, showcasing the integration of advanced computer vision techniques with efficient backend processing and a user-friendly interface.</p>
